What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think that reaching out for help and chatting with my classmates really worked for me. Also trying to write out some psuedocode was very helpful for me. 

Something that did not work very well for me was adjusting to the new OOP methods needed for this code to work. I would get help with a specifc piece of the code and understand the answer, but then when I tried to do the next peice I would feel stuck again, and had trouble transfering the information I was learning into slightly different coding operations. 

Advice I would give is go to office hours with specific questions, so look at code before hand to figure out what exactly is confusing then as a more specific question. This will help understanding, and make the time in office/TA hours much more effective.
